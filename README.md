# Bank Loan Analysis
### Aim
To analyze bank loan data to evaluate loan performance, customer profiles, and financial health for better lending decisions.
### Objective
To track total loan applications, funded amounts, received amounts, and key KPIs like interest rate and debt-to-income ratio, while comparing good vs bad loans and identifying trends by region, term, and employee length
### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
- Total Loan Applications: 
We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications.
- Total Funded Amount:
Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount metric.
- Total Amount Received:
 Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Receive.
- Average Interest Rate:
 Calculating the average interest rate across all loans which will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):
 Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans.
### Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s

### Good Loan:
- Good Loan Application Percentage
- Good Loan Applications
- Good Loan Funded Amount
- Good Loan Total Received Amount
### Bad Loan:
- Bad Loan Application Percentage
- Bad Loan Applications
- Bad Loan Funded Amount
- Bad Loan Total Received Amount
### Charts:
- Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line/ Area Chart):
    To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities
- Regional Analysis by State (Bar Chart):
  To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities
- Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):
  To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
- Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):
  How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
- Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):
   Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
- Home Ownership Analysis (Tree/ Heat Map):
   For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.

### Tools:
1.Python – for data analysis and scripting

2.Jupyter Notebook – for interactive coding and visualization

3.Pandas – for data cleaning and manipulation

4.NumPy – for numerical computations

5.Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization and trend analysis
### What I did in this Project:
1.Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on bank loan dataset to study loan performance and borrower behavior.

2.Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing — handled missing values, removed duplicates, treated outliers, and encoded categorical data.

3.Analyzed key factors like income, credit history, loan amount, and loan status to find patterns affecting loan approvals and defaults.

4.Created data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover insights and trends.

5.Derived meaningful insights to help banks make data-driven lending decisions and improve financial risk assessment.

### Conclusion:
The analysis helps the bank understand lending patterns, identify risk areas, improve loan approval strategies, and optimize financial performance through data-driven insights.
